# api
### why
because there are some things I'd like api's for when the provider doesn't supply them, so I write my own.
### categories
#### beer

- [Tired Hands](http://www.tiredhands.com/), both the [ferm](http://www.tiredhands.com/fermentaria/beers/) and [cafe](http://www.tiredhands.com/cafe/beers/)
- [Evil Genius](http://evilgeniusbeer.com/), because I live here
- [Monk's Cafe](http://www.monkscafe.com/on-tap/), breaking the rules, but Monks always has a changing craft beer selection on tap
- [Dock Street](http://www.dockstreetbeer.com/whats-on-tap/)
